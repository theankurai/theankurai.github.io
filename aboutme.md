## Summary
---

A Data Scientist with nearly 3 years of work experience in developing predictive models and delivering end-to-end machine learning solutions. I have worked on problems such as sentiment analysis, email classification, OCR (reading text from images), information extraction (NER & intent classification), image recognition, text similarity and object detection (Yolov5) using machine learning, deep learning and NLP algorithms.
